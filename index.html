    <h3><em>Scientists aboard the Norwegian icebreaker Kronprins Haakon are studying the the passageway between Greenland and the Norwegian Arctic archipelago Svalbard to determine how warming temperatures and melting ice in the Arctic may be changing a system of currents that drives global weather patterns. A new report warns that the AMOC is one of nine critical climate systems that greenhouse-gas-fueled warming is actively pushing toward a tipping point. Crossing that threshold in one of these systems could trigger rapid and irreversible changes that drive other systems over the edge—leading to a global tipping cascade with catastrophic consequences for the planet. The analysis, released last week in Nature by an international group of leading climate scientists, says the tipping point risks are greater than most of us realize.</em></h3>
